On the topic of innovative cable news, many of us probably think of
Ted Turner and CNN---the first broadcast of its kind to offer 24-7
news in aggregate via network television. Although CNN first launched
on June 1st 1980, they were not the first to implement this business
model. In fact, ESPN beat them to the punch.

Founded by Bill Rasmussen and his son Scott, ESPN first launched their
American-based, global cable and satellite television channel on
September 7th, 1979. Today ESPN is a drastically different network
which has managed to adapt through the “new media” era to remain the
top sports website on the internet despite competition from others
like Bleacher Report and Yahoo Sports.

ESPN’s website launched in 1995 and was initially called
`ESPNet.SportsZone.com`. In its early stages, it was nowhere near as
impactful and connecting in terms of bringing sports fans
together. Thanks to its partnerships with sports leagues and
technological advances coming out of silicon valley, ESPN’s website is
now a hub of engagement and connection for millions of fans. When
viewing their page on the home screen, you can see “ESPN: The
Worldwide Leader of Sports” when placing the cursor on the tab. At the
top they have live scores and you can even click on any game that is
currently being played no matter the sport, which will navigate you to
the box score with stats, highlights, the latest tweets from staff
writers, and a play by play with minimal animation. You can even
follow the news of your favorite teams which are updated at a constant
rate. Though you can’t navigate to NBA.com or NHL.com, with the
partnerships between ESPN and the multitude of professional sports
websites, you can easily get the same information from, let’s say
celtics.com. Most of the beat writers for professional sports teams
work for ESPN. Within ESPN’s online page there are other sites within
the site such as ESPN Deportes, SportsNation, and X games giving users
more ways to get the information they need.

You can connect with “The Worldwide Leader of Sports” via Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram, Snapchat, and even ESPN Daily which after signing
up, gives the consumer other ways of getting trending sports related
news. ESPN Daily has the feel of an email account and “delivers the
biggest sports news and moments directly to your inbox.” Another cool
way you can connect with ESPN via social media platforms- you can
watch shows like *Mike & Mike* and “join the conversation” by following
the show on twitter ([@mikeandmike](https://twitter.com/mikeandmike)).

You can engage and interact with most if not all of ESPN’s numerous
sports shows such as SportsNation, which has it’s own webpage within
the ESPN website, and First Take. By connecting with these programs on
social media you can implement your own ideas of where the anchors
should direct their conversations. This new wave of engagement which
was not possible a decade ago has definitely made a huge impact in how
ESPN can interact with its viewers.

Sometimes there can be flaws in regards to the use of social media;
not just for viewers and fans but also for those employed by said
company, which I might add is owned by Disney. There are [social media
guidelines](https://www.espnfrontrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/NOV-2-RECEIVED-UPDATED-SOCIAL-MEDIA-GUIDELINES-10.221.pdf) put in place by ESPN for their anchors and staff
writers. Their original policy was released in [2011](http://www.espnfrontrow.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/social-networking-v2-2011.pdf), revised in twice before the Presidential election, then those were
finally tweaked in [April of this year](http://www.espn.com/blog/ombudsman/post/_/id/816/new-espn-guidelines-recognize-connection-between-sports-politics).

Recently, *SC6* co-host [Jemele Hill was suspended for 2 weeks](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/09/sports/football/jemele-hill-suspended-espn.html) after
violating this policy. The guidelines warn against political bias and
to avoid “overt partnership, personal attacks, and inflammatory
rhetoric on social media.” In September 2017, Hill took to social
media to call out Jerry Jones, owner of the Dallas Cowboys after he
stated that any player “disrespecting the flag” will not
play. 

{{< tweet 917190812706000897 >}}

He was referencing the NFL player protests that have recently
taken place. From the perspective of the players this protest is
supposed to be on the topic of police brutality towards the black
community but unfortunately a large portion of Americans took the
protests as disrespectful to the flag and members of the
U.S. military. Hill later tweeted “if you strongly reject what Jerry
Jones said” the key is boycotting his (Jones) advertisers. 

{{< tweet 917220603085688832 >}}

This
suspension took place just weeks after Hill’s first incident in which
she used Twitter to call President Trump a [“white supremacist,”](https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2017/09/15/espns-jemele-hill-stands-by-her-statement-that-trump-is-a-white-supremacist/) which
was [in violation](https://twitter.com/ESPNPR/status/907683111693164545) of the political bias rule that had been previously
implemented.

We now live in a connected world where we are obligated to engage on
social media whether as a sports journalist/anchor and fans or in
everyday life for that matter regardless of the social
environment. This is the current social climate within many
professions and as employees we must adhere to the rules that have
been executed by our company’s policies. As we can see from the Jemele
Hill incident, we must have some sort of awareness as to the dialogue
we choose to take on and the execution of said dialogue on social
media platforms.

As a sports fan in general, I love the engagement that social media
has brought to the world of sports and through ESPN. Its convenience
is stellar; allowing consumers to communicate with players, staff, and
other fans through a hybrid version of secondary interpersonal
communication. We are still in the age of a new frontier where online
connection has infiltrated almost every aspect of our lives. It will
be interesting to see where this all goes next in terms of sports web
pages and engagement with fans and consumer.
