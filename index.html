        <h2><a href="/com267f17p4/post/quant/">Twitter and Online Sports Reporting</a></h2>
        By looking at the content on major sports news outlets, we can get an aggregate understanding of how social media websites are integrated with sports journalism.
Twitter in particular has established itself as the social media platform most associated with breaking news. Journalists often use Twitter to take their followers behind the scenes or to give their personal views and insights. Though this use evolved and was established by the behavior of individual journalists, it now is practically impossible for many journalists today to work without some sort of Twitter presence.

        On the topic of innovative cable news, many of us probably think of Ted Turner and CNN&mdash;the first broadcast of its kind to offer 24-7 news in aggregate via network television. Although CNN first launched on June 1st 1980, they were not the first to implement this business model. In fact, ESPN beat them to the punch.
  Founded by Bill Rasmussen and his son Scott, ESPN first launched their American-based, global cable and satellite television channel on September 7th, 1979.
